\# AlgoStudio Foundation

Last Updated: 2026

\## 1. Mission

AlgoStudio exists to prevent traders from deploying fake edges.

Algorithmic strategies should never go live without verification.

We are building the verification layer and pre-live ritual for systematic trading.

---

\## 2. Core Identity

AlgoStudio is trust infrastructure.

We are NOT primarily:

\- an EA builder

\- a strategy marketplace

\- a signal platform

\- an AI strategy generator

The builder exists as onboarding.

Verification is the product.

---

\## 3. Product North Star

AlgoStudio must become:

"The final checkpoint before risking real capital."

If traders feel comfortable deploying without us,

we are failing.

---

\## 4. Target User (Early Stage)

We optimize for:

Serious systematic traders who:

\- understand robustness

\- care about capital protection

\- have experienced strategy decay

\- value statistical integrity

We do NOT optimize for beginners or hype-driven traders.

Success = 300 fanatical verified traders.

---

\## 5. Core Capabilities (Not Features)

AlgoStudio is built around 5 systems:

1\. Strategy Identity System

&nbsp; - Persistent strategy ID

&nbsp; - Version history

&nbsp; - Verification lineage

2\. Lifecycle State Machine

&nbsp; - Draft

&nbsp; - Backtested

&nbsp; - Verified

&nbsp; - Live Monitoring

&nbsp; - Edge At Risk

&nbsp; - Invalidated

3\. Verification Engine

&nbsp; - Robustness validation

&nbsp; - Monte Carlo stress testing

&nbsp; - Overfit detection

&nbsp; - Clear decision output

4\. Monitoring Engine

&nbsp; - Baseline vs live drift

&nbsp; - Edge decay detection

&nbsp; - State transitions

5\. Proof Infrastructure

&nbsp; - Integrity sealing

&nbsp; - Tamper-resistant records

&nbsp; - Public verification layer (long-term)

We build systems, not isolated features.

---

\## 6. Decision Principle

Every feature must answer:

"Does this reduce the probability of a trader deploying a false edge?"

If not, it is secondary.

---

\## 7. Ritual Requirement

AlgoStudio must create a behavioral checkpoint:

Pre-Live Verification Check

Output must be clear:

\- READY

\- UNCERTAIN

\- NOT_DEPLOYABLE

Clarity over complexity.

---

\## 8. Engineering Philosophy

\- Architecture before implementation.

\- Explicit state machines over implicit logic.

\- Single source of truth per strategy.

\- Verification logic must be UI-independent.

\- Reliability > feature velocity.

---

\## 9. Growth Philosophy

We are building a standard, not chasing growth hacks.

Early success signals:

\- Traders voluntarily share verification.

\- Traders say: "Did you verify it?"

\- Prop firms show curiosity.

Mass user growth is not the early KPI.

---

\## 10. Non-Goals (Early Stage)

We are not:

\- optimizing for feature arms races

\- competing on indicator count

\- building AI auto-strategy hype tools

\- building copy-trading infrastructure

Focus wins.
